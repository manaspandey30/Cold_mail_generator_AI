**Imagine a scenario:**

- Nike needs a Principal Software Engineer and is spending time and resources in the hiring process, on boarding, training etc
- Your company is a Software Development company that can provide a dedicated software development engineer to Nike. So, your business development executive is going to reach out to Nike via a cold email.
